		Self-Help and Coping Tips 
		to Overcome Depression

	</h1>
<h3>	
	Depression drains your energy, hope, and drive, making it difficult to do 
	what you need to feel better.

	But while overcoming depression isn't quick or easy, it's far from impossible. 
	
	You can't just will yourself to "snap out of it," but you do have some 
	control-even if your depression 
	is severe and stubbornly persistent. 
	
	The key is to start small and build from there. 
	
	Feeling better takes time, but you can get there if you make positive choices
	 for yourself each day.


Recovering from depression requires action, but taking action when you're 
depressed is hard.

In fact, just thinking about the things you should do to feel better, like going 
for a walk or spending time with friends, can be exhausting.

It's the Catch-22 of depression recovery: The things that help the most are the 
things that are the most difficult to do. 

There's a difference, however, between something that's difficult and something 
that's impossible.

The key to depression recovery is to start with a few small goals and slowly 
build from there.

Draw upon whatever resources you have. 

You may not have much energy, but you probably have enough to take a short walk 
around the block or 
pick up the phone to call a loved one.

Take things one day at a time and reward yourself for each accomplishment. 

The steps may seem small, but they'll quickly add up. 

And for all the energy you put into your depression recovery, you'll get back 
much more in return.


	<h1>Depression Self-Help Tip 1: 
	Get Support</h1>
<h3>
Getting the support you need plays a big role in lifting the fog of depression 
and keeping it away. 

On your own, it can be difficult to maintain perspective and sustain the effort 
required to beat depression, 
but the very nature of depression makes it difficult to reach out for help. 

However, isolation and loneliness make depression even worse, 
so maintaining your close relationships and social activities are important.

The thought of reaching out to even close family members and friends can seem overwhelming. 

You may feel ashamed, too exhausted to talk, or guilty for neglecting the relationship. 

Remind yourself that this is the depression talking. 

Reaching out is not a sign of weakness and it won't mean you're a burden to others. 

Your loved ones care about you and want to help. 

And remember, it's never too late to build new friendships and improve your support network.


Turn to trusted friends and family members. 

Share what you're going through with the people you love and trust, face to face if possible. 

The people you talk to don't have to be able to fix you; they just need to be good listeners. 

Ask for the help and support you need. 

You may have retreated from your most treasured relationships, but they can get you 
through this tough time.

Try to keep up with social activities even if you don't feel like it. 

Often when you're depressed, it feels more comfortable to retreat into your shell, 
but being around other people
 will make you feel less depressed.
Join a support group for depression. 

Being with others dealing with depression can go a long way in reducing your sense of isolation. 

You can also encourage each other, give and receive advice on how to cope, and share your 
experiences.

	Depression Self-Help Tip 2: 
	Beat Negative Thinking 
</h1><h3>

Depression puts a negative spin on everything, including the way you see yourself, the situations 
you encounter, and your expectations for the future.

But you can't break out of this pessimistic mind frame by "just thinking positive." 

Happy thoughts or wishful thinking won't cut it. 

Rather, the trick is to replace negative thoughts with more balanced thoughts.

Think outside yourself. Ask yourself if you'd say what you're thinking about yourself to someone 
else. 

If not, stop being so hard on yourself. 

Think about less harsh statements that offer more realistic descriptions.

Allow yourself to be less than perfect. 

Many depressed people are perfectionists, holding themselves to impossibly high standards and 
then beating themselves up when they fail to meet them. 

Battle this source of self-imposed stress by challenging your negative ways of thinking. 

Socialize with positive people.

 Notice how people who always look on the bright side deal with challenges, even minor ones, 
 like not being able to find a parking space. 

 Then consider how you would react in the same situation. 

 Even if you have to pretend, try to adopt their optimism and persistence in the face of difficulty.

Keep a "negative thought log." 

Whenever you experience a negative thought, jot down the thought and what triggered it in a notebook. 

Review your log when you're in a good mood. 

Consider if the negativity was truly warranted. 

Ask yourself if there's another way to view the situation. 

For example, let's say your boyfriend was short with you and you automatically assumed that the 
relationship was in trouble. 

It's possible, though, he's just having a bad day.

<h1>Depression Self-Help Tip 3: 
	Take care of yourself
	
</h1><h3>

In order to overcome depression, you have to take care of yourself. 

This includes following a healthy lifestyle, learning to manage stress, setting limits on 
what you're able to do, adopting healthy habits, and scheduling fun activities into your day.

Aim for eight hours of sleep. 

Depression typically involves sleep problems. 

Whether you're sleeping too little or too much, your mood suffers. 

Get on a better sleep schedule by learning healthy sleep habits.

Expose yourself to a little sunlight every day. Lack of sunlight can make depression worse.

 Make sure you're getting enough. 

 Take a short walk outdoors, have your coffee outside, enjoy an al fresco meal, people-watch on a 
 park bench, or sit out in the garden. 

 Aim for at least 15 minutes of sunlight a day to boost your mood. 

 If you live somewhere with little winter sunshine, try using a light therapy box.

Keep stress in check. Not only does stress prolong and worsen depression, but it can also trigger it. 

 Figure out all the things in your life that stress you out. 

 Examples include: work overload, unsupportive relationships, taking on too much, or health problems. 

 Once you've identified your stressors, you can make a plan to avoid them or minimize their impact.

Practice relaxation techniques. 

A daily relaxation practice can help relieve symptoms of depression, reduce stress, and boost 
feelings of joy and well-being. 

Try yoga, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation.

Care for a pet.

 While nothing can replace the human connection, pets can bring joy and companionship into your 
 life and help you feel less isolated. 

 Caring for a pet can also get you outside of yourself and give you a sense of being needed-both 
 powerful antidotes to depression.

Do things you enjoy (or used to)

While you can't force yourself to have fun or experience pleasure, you can choose to do things that 
you used to enjoy. 

Pick up a former hobby or a sport you used to like. 

Express yourself creatively through music, art, or writing. 

Go out with friends. Take a day trip to a museum, the mountains, or the ballpark.


Push yourself to do things, even when you don't feel like it. 

You might be surprised at how much better you feel once you're out in the world. 

Even if your depression doesn't lift immediately, you'll gradually feel more upbeat and energetic 
as you make time for fun activities.

Develop a wellness toolbox

Come up with a list of things that you can do for a quick mood boost.

 Include any strategies, activities, or skills that have helped in the past. 

The more "tools" for coping with depression, the better. 

Try and implement a few of these ideas each day, even if you're feeling good.


Spend some time in nature

List what you like about yourself

Read a good book

Watch a funny movie or TV show

Take a long, hot bath

Take care of a few small tasks

Play with a pet

Talk to friends or family face-to-face

Listen to music

Do something spontaneous

Depression Self-Help Tip 4: 
Get regular exercise
</h1><h3>
When you're depressed, exercising may be the last thing you feel like doing. 
But exercise is a powerful tool for dealing with depression. 
In fact, studies show that regular exercise can be as effective as antidepressant medication at 
increasing energy levels and decreasing feelings of fatigue.


Scientists haven't figured out exactly why exercise is such a potent antidepressant, 
but evidence suggests that physical activity triggers new cell growth in the brain, 
increases mood-enhancing neurotransmitters and endorphins, reduces stress, 
and relieves muscle tension-all things that can have a positive effect on depression.


To gain the most benefits, aim for 30 minutes of exercise per day. 

You can start small, though, as short 10-minute bursts of activity can have a positive 
effect on your mood.

 Here are a few easy ways to get moving:
<ul>

Take the stairs rather than the elevator

Park your car in the farthest spot in the lot

Take your dog for a walk

Pair up with an exercise partner

Walk while you're talking on the phone
</ul>

As a next step, try incorporating walks or some other enjoyable, easy form of exercise into 
your daily routine. 

The key is to pick an activity you enjoy, so you're more likely to keep up with it.

<h2>Exercise as an Antidepressant</h2>
<h3>
The following exercise tips offer a powerful prescription for boosting mood:
<ul>
Exercise now… and again. 

A 10-minute walk can improve your mood for two hours. The key to sustaining mood 
benefits is to exercise regularly.

Choose activities that are moderately intense. 

Aerobic exercise undoubtedly has mental health benefits, but you don't need to sweat 
strenuously to see results.

Find exercises that are continuous and rhythmic (rather than intermittent).Walking, 
swimming, dancing, stationery biking, and yoga are good choices.

Add a mind-body element. Activities such as yoga and tai chi rest your mind and increase 
your energy. 

You can also add a meditative element to walking or swimming by repeating a mantra 
(a word or phrase) as you move.

Start slowly, and don't overdo it. More isn't better. 

Athletes who over train find their moods drop rather than lift.
</ul></h3>
<h1>
	Depression Self-Help Tip 5: 
	Eat a healthy, mood-boosting diet
</h1>
<h3>
What you eat has a direct impact on the way you feel. 

Aim for a balanced diet of low-fat protein, complex carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables. 

Reduce your intake of foods that can adversely affect your brain and mood, such as caffeine, alcohol, 
trans fats, saturated fats, and foods with high levels of chemical preservatives or hormones.

Don't skip meals. 

Going too long between meals can make you feel irritable and tired, so aim to eat 
something at least every three to four hours.

Minimize sugar and refined carbs. 

You may crave sugary snacks, baked goods, or comfort foods such as pasta or French fries, 
but these "feel-good" foods quickly lead to a crash in mood and energy.

Focus on complex carbohydrates. 

Foods such as baked potatoes, whole-wheat pasta, oatmeal, and whole grain breads can boost 
serotonin levels without a crash.

Boost your vitamins, eat more citrus fruit, leafy greens, beans, chicken, and eggs.

Try super-foods rich in nutrients that can boost mood, such as bananas, brown rice and spinach.

Omega-3 fatty acids play an essential role in stabilizing mood, the best sources are fatty fish
 such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines. 

When cooking fish, grill or bake rather than fry.
